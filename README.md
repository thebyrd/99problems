## Overview ##
pg says that the best startup problems are problems that you personally face and can solve better than a large tech giant. Let's stop talking about startup ideas and start talking about problems. Let's see if we can get to 99 of them and determine if there is a common trend.

## Problems ##
1. Businesses (like Ferris) are unable to adapt to the post-pc era when they should theoretically be flourishing from it.
2. Most startups don't utilize commoditized data science approaches that would make their lives easier & product better.
3. Differentiating raw counts of user actions (clicks, drags, etc) from actual engagement.
4. Relating / managing cross network data.
5. When I'm not in NYC I wonder why nothing is open at 10pm. The solution might be an app that helps me stay organized, but it would be way more interesting to see if you could turn any small city into NYC by just connecting people better. There has got to be at least 1 place open this late.
6. I have a fuck load of books and so do alot of my friends. Why don't we own a library together. What would a modern library look like?
7. Communication and collaboration with my doctor is virtually nonexistent. It's a one-way relationship. At best, my relationship with my doctor is one of an acquaintance, where it should be like that of a good friend. Also, I don't remember everything the doctor says.
