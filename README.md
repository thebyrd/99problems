pg says that the best startup problems are problems that you personally face and can solve better than a large tech giant. Let's stop talking about startup ideas and start talking about problems. Let's see if we can get to 99 of them and determine if there is a common trend.

## Problems ##
1. Businesses (like Ferris) are unable to adapt to the post-pc era when they should theoretically be flourishing from it.
2. Most startups don't utilize commoditized data science approaches that would make their lives easier & product better.
3. Differentiating raw counts of user actions (clicks, drags, etc) from actual engagement.
4. Relating / managing cross network data.
